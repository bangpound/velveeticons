Helveticons
===========

This module generates variations of 1-bit icons using techniques lifted from [Imagecache](<http://drupal.org/project/imagecache>).

The module was developed specifically for the [Helveticons](<http://helveticons.ch>) icon set, but they should be generalizable for other icon sets.
